Figure1: Flowchart of the Process

The flowchart outlines the process of the study, starting with inputting an image and then applying Algorithm 1 or Algorithm 2 on each image.
For this study, we collected a real-world dataset of 10 images depicting cars in the rain for testing and validation purposes using our own camera equipment.
The format of the images is set to be PNG. 
This dataset is utilized to develop and refine our two novel algorithms. 
The methodology combines state-of-the-art computer vision-based image processing techniques, leveraging the powerful capabilities of CVIPtools.

The output of Algorithm 1 is the processed image obtained after applying anisotropic diffusion, histogram stretch, and unsharp masking techniques to the input image. The output is expected to have reduced noise, improved contrast, and enhanced details compared to the original image of a car in the rain.
